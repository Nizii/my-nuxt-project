Online exhibition for the City Museum of Aarau during the lockdown.
Our team consisted of 2 designers and 2 IT specialists (frontend and backend).
The module also included discussions with the client and the collection of requirements.
I developed the backend using .Net and Azure. MongoDB was used as the database.
The development period was 6 weeks.
