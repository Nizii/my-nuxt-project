Shield Heroe is a VR game where you defeat enemies with shields. 
These shields can be thrown like boomerangs or can reflect the projectiles of the enemies. 
The development team consisted of three computer scientists. 
I was responsible for the throwing and deflecting motions of the shields, among other things. 
The world is constructed from hexagons and stands out for its uniqueness, 
as it is created through a generative process.
Development period: 6 weeks.
