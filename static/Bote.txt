As part of a module mentorship, I created a bot that trades with Bitcoins.
It applies two strategies: MAVG (Moving Average) and RSI (Relative Strength Index).
It is best suited for high-frequency trading on a second or minute basis.
This project is an individual project, which I programmed using Python.
The bot trades via the Lykke or Kraken broker, which provide the REST-API or gRPC.
Since April 2022, I have been collecting Bitcoin data at second intervals using a data collector bot, which I also wrote in Python.
The goal is to simulate and optimize the bot over a larger dataset spanning years at second intervals.
The bot runs on the Pythonanywhere Cloud.
Development period: 12 weeks.
