An interactive wine list for people with limited wine knowledge,
and for restaurants that can't afford a sommelier,
but still want to offer a wine experience. The team consisted of me and a designer.
The frontend was developed with Nuxt.js, the backend with .Net.
The database used was MongoDB.
Additionally, I worked with JWT tokens and BCrypt.
The calculation of the match between the user's taste profile and
that of the wine was done using the Euclidean distance formula.
This involved calculating the distance of points from two arrays, 
summing them up, and displaying as a percentage.
Development period: 12 weeks.
