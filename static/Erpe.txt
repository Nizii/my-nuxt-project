As part of a module mentorship, I developed an initial version of an ERP system 
for a one-man plumbing business. The scope of this module included 
the collection of requirements, service level agreements, 
a prototype, and the implementation of an initial functional version. 
The system (Version 2) is still in development. I am working on it alone. 
I designed it using Figma. I developed the frontend with Vue.js and 
the backend with .Net. I use MySQL as the database. 
Development period: 12 weeks.
